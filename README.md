Daichi-kun Crisis: Do Natural [English Hack by washbear]
========================================================

This is an attempt at making an English romhack for a Japan-only
1989 farming simulator / real-time strategy game based on a family of
Cow farmers living on a volcanic island. It is for the PC Engine
(TurboGrafx 16).

The game uses an 8-bit text encoding with separate "fonts" for
Katakana and Hiragana, which are switched between using single
byte markers. There isn't support for combining characters, so
dakuten marks are accomplished by having a separate line of
whitespace and accent marks that is drawn over the previous
line of text. See `reference.txt` for further information.
